# My garage

Indie projects, old internet, new internet, and stuff that I like. Just my place to be.

I'm going to start rough documentation of things I'm learning, along with concepts I've already seen but completely forgotten. This will help me in the near future to have my projects documented and maintain a variety of implementations of how I've been doing things. This way I can refer back to my own work in future projects and avoid wasting time searching, testing, etc. Even when I do spend time researching, I can build upon what I've already done to advance further in my learning.

## My PHP Evolution

Just in case someone starting php ever sees my project and thinks it's interesting of any use for them, ill let you know how it started for me like I said before it will also help myself.

- [Spaghetti script in the same php file](#spaghetti)
- [Basic MVC hibrid bettween my spaghetti and new ideas](#spaghetti-hibrid)
- [This attempt to do more of a Standard MVC like the ones in frameworks](#standard-mvc)

## The Last Garage Kid

I like where this is going.

## Structure

I've tried to create folders that refence themselves and also that can be similar to what you find in laravel or even in a node backend, since folders structures tend to be similar. I could have done a separated folder like "Backend" or something similar but do to the small nature of this project I tought it was not necessary, ill just keep this really simple.

- [routes]
- [views]
- [models]
- [controllers]
- [helpers]
- [config]
- [assets]
- [vendor]
