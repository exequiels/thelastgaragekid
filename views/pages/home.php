    <h3 class="fs-6">What is this project about or how did it start?</h3>
    <p class="mt-3">
      I continue practicing React and learning how a Laravel backend works. This is a simple collaborative to-do list: you create a list and share it with someone via WhatsApp. Complete tasks on your own or with family and friends, the list expires after 24 hours.
    </p><p>
      You donâ€™t need to register; just generate a list and share it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought it could be useful not only for practice, but also for personal tasks. For example, sometimes my wife and I buy groceries and we go back and forth, so this is an easy way to track what we bought or did during the day.

  <div class="p-2 m-1 ms-2">Some tools, librarys, extensions, I'm using and Id like to have links for. Sometimes you need to reinstall things, update, read docs, etc. It's nice to know what you're using, especially when you get so used to them that you forget about them. The list is incomplete I'll be adding the rest later and probably it will expand in a near future...</div>

    <h3 class="fs-6">What is this project about or how did it start?</h3>
    <p class="mt-3">
      This project is all about kids birthday cards, you pick a template, edit and send, or you totally customize it. You don't need to be an expert but just take a few minutes and read. 
    </p><p>
      You dont need to registry just generate a link and share it. The web is spanish and english, it changes language depending on your browsers language.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was practicing context, and I had to do a card for my sons birthday. So I ended up doing a small project, basically a main layout that picks all the choises and while you build it you see the result next to the builder.
