    <h3 class="fs-6">What is this project about or how did it start?</h3>
    <p class="mt-3">
      This project is all about kids birthday cards, you pick a template, edit and send, or you totally customize it. You don't need to be an expert but just take a few minutes and read. 
    </p><p>
      You dont need to registry just generate a link and share it. The web is spanish and english, it changes language depending on your browsers language.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was practicing context, and I had to do a card for my sons birthday. So I ended up doing a small project, basically a main layout that picks all the choises and while you build it you see the result next to the builder.
