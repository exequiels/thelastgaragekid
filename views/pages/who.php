            I just love Kung Fu Panda, and specially the fight against KAI where POO is asked who is he?(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_lFHHSt-uI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">POO Dragon Warrior Scene</a>)
            a student, a techear, all of them, etc. So something similar applys here. I'm just a person enjoying what it likes.

            So 4 or 5 five years ago, I was sick, got out the hospital and quited my job, and tryed to find something related to a computer, the chance was given and I took it.
            In my new work there were lots of repetitive tasks and with the php manual on my hand it all started for me as developer.

            But this story goes back further I've been reinventing my self since before, I used to spray paint cars for years and I started that job because I love art and just found a small workshop and offered my self to work for free, just for the knowledge of it, I had 27 at the time. And thats how I became a Spray Painter(paid of course :P), but thats another story.
